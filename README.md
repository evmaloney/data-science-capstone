### Problem Statement
Global warming and climate change has our planet careening toward a catostrophic situation of unbeknownst proportions. We as a society, need to do better. The question is, who is most to blame and in turn and who needs to do the most to change?

We know that CO2 output from vehicles is one of the greatest contributors to the problem of climate change, but exactly who is contributing to it the most? Is it the rich executive driving the $250,000 Bentley? Is it the college student driving an old Nissan? Or is the somewhere in between - maybe a middle class parent driving a $25,000 Honda Accord?

### Hypothesis
The hyphothesis is that, in general, the higher end car brands output the highest levels of CO2 and the trend continues downward to lower end brands outputting the lowest amounts of CO2. Using emissions factors of CO2 grams per mile for each brand's vehicles will help in finding this to be true or not.
