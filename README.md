### Problem Statement
Global warming and climate change has our planet careening toward a catostrophic situation of unbeknownst proportions. We as a society, need to do better. The question is, who is most to blame and in turn, and who needs to do the most to change?

We know that CO2 output from vehicles is one of the greatest contributors to the problem of climate change, but exactly who is contributing to it the most? Is it the rich executive driving the $250,000 Bentley? Is it the college student driving an old $2,500 Nissan? Or is it somewhere in between - maybe a middle class parent driving a $25,000 Honda Accord?

#### Hypothesis
The hyphothesis is that, in general, the higher end car brands output the highest levels of CO2 and the trend continues downward to lower end brands outputting the lowest amounts of CO2. Using emissions factors of CO2 grams per mile for each brand's vehicles, we will be able to build a model to predict what brands are having a greater contribution to climate change.

#### Goal and Success Metrics
The goal is for a buyer to consider our findings when choosing a car to buy. Maybe, even though they can afford it, they don't choose that higher end brand and consider something a little more modest. This will let them, for one, do their part in curbing climate change, and two, possibly put the money they save towards something more meaningful to them.

#### Risks
The main risk I see is the factor or yearly outputs. Because our dataset dates back to 1984, technology has come a long way and a certain car brand that maybe, in comparison to others, had higher CO2 emmissions in 1984 may not neccessarily today and vice versa. This may blur our overall findings.

### Dataset
I will be using this dataset to work with: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/epa/fuel-economy/
I've already downloaded the CSV file.
