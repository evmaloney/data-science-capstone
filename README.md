### Problem Statement
Global warming and climate change has our planet careening toward a catostrophic situation of unbeknownst proportions. We as a society, need to do better. The question is, who is most to blame and in turn and who needs to do the most to change?

Is it the rich executive driving the $250,000 Bentley? Is it the college student driving an old Honda? Or is the somewhere in between - maybe a middle class parent driving a $25,000
